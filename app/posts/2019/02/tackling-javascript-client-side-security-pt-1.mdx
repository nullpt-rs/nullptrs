    Jscrambler, a leader in JavaScript Client-side security makes claims to “Bullet-proof your
    Web Application in 2 minutes” but what have they done to make these claims? And does it
    really bulletproof your application?
</p>

<p>
    Jscrambler employs various techniques to both obfuscate the code and prevent real-time
    debugging/tampering. A list of the techniques is provided by the Jscrambler product page
    and even contains docs to what each feature does (This will be extremely helpful)
</p>
# Getting a Sample To Reverse
<p>
    The first step in reversing Jscrambler is to get our hands on an obfuscated sample. Lucky
    for us, we’re able to sign up and demo their protection using a game they provide. Even
    better, they provide the unprotected version as well! This is useful for comparison.
</p>

<p>
    The Playground App is more than enough for us to pick apart how Jscrambler works and how
    to reverse its effects. Clicking on View App brings you to the page where you’re able to
    fine-tune the protection to your liking.
</p>

<p>
    You’re then able to protect the app and run it. Pressing the Run Source and Run Protected
    buttons will create an iframe with the running application. We’re then able to get the
    source though the Chrome Dev Tools

# Side by Side Comparison

![Original code on the left, Jscrambler protected code on right](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/6-2.png)

<p>
    Looking at the obfuscated code vs the original code a few things stood out to me. The
    first being the difference in lines of code. The protected application sits at 907 lines
    of code while the original only contains 559. This nearly double in LoC had to be coming
    from somewhere. The second thing I noticed was all of the obfuscated function calls and
    string references. A quick glance at their docs brings me to what they call [String Concealing](https://docs.jscrambler.com/code-integrity/documentation/transformations/string-concealing)
</p>

<p>
    Our protected code is littered with calls to the decode routines so I had a bright idea to
    isolate the decode functions by copying them to a different file.
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/8-1.png)

<p>
    Jumping to the function using ctrl + clicking on one of them brings me to the top of the
    file where many similar functions are defined. After multiple scrolls I notice our code
    starts but is wrapped around what seems to be an IIFE
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/9-1.png)

<p>
    Copying all the functions above this IIFE into another file and removing them from the
    protected code brings our lines of code from 907 down to 629. This means the majority of
    the increase in LoC we noticed was due to these decode/encode algorithms.
</p>
# Extracting Data From Functions
<p>
    My next idea was to try and test one of decode functions by just running it and hoping to
    get no errors.
</p>
<p>Well, let’s try that.</p>
<p>
    To do this, I grabbed one of the calls to the decode function and console.log it in my
    file with all the decode functions.
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/10-1.png)

<p>Now, lets call node testing.js</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/11-1.png)

<p>
    a3U is not defined, hmm. I check back to the protected code and realize a3U is pointing to
    a global variable named A1aa
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/12-1.png)

<p>So I change a3U in the test to A1aa</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/13-1.png)

<p>And try running it again</p>

# It Returns toInt!
<p>
    At this point I was very excited. This means I was able to isolate these functions and use
    them to deobfuscate the code a bit.
</p>
<p>Woohoo!</p>
<p>
    I even went a step further and used a for loop to try printing out any other strings we
    can get.
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/15-1.png)

<p>And now to run it.</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/16-1.png)

<p>Awesome! We get a bunch of strings and function names.</p>
<p>
    Only one problem. I don’t really want to sit here and replace each occurrence by hand.
    Whatever, I’ll just write a script that uses Regex to find these functions and replace
    them with the results using eval.
</p>
# STOP!
<p>
    While this technique would technically work and is what I started out with, there is a
    better way to do this and its using an AST.
</p>
<p>
    An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree that represents the syntax of a language. For us
    this means we can pick apart functions and function calls given a set of criteria.
</p>
<p>Great, now where do we start?</p>
<p>
    [Esprima](https://github.com/jquery/esprima) is a popular parser and is what we’ll be using to do this.
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/17-1.png)

<p>
    Esprima has an example of removing console calls from a program using their tool. I will
    be using this as the base to find all the calls to the decode functions and replace them.
    One tool useful for this is [ASTExplorer](ASTExplorer) which allows you to explore the syntax tree of the code you provide.
</p>
<p>
    First step, identifying the decode functions and storing their name so we can find
    occurrences in the code.
</p>
<p>
    Pasting one of these functions in ASTExplorer lets us know we’re dealing with an
    ExpressionStatement
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/18-1.png)

<p>What we care about is K3U or the property identifier</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/19.png)

<p>
    We know each decode function belongs to A1aa so we’ll use that to extract the function
    names.
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/20.png)

<p>Using this code we’re able to print the decode functions out and take a look.</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/21.png)

<p>Great, but we only care about the function name.</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/22.png)


![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/23.png)

<p>
    Cool! We got the function names now we need to replace each call to them in the code with
    their returned value. I return to ASTExplorer but this time inspect a line where one of
    these decode functions is called.
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/24.png)

<p>
    The call is defined as a CallExpression. Inside the CallExpression contains other
    information such as the arguments passed, callee, and types.
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/25.png)

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/26.png)

<p>
    Using ASTExplorer we’re able to build another predicate which checks if the function is a
    CallExpression and its callee’s property name is one of our decode functions. Now we just
    want to replace these calls with their actual value!
</p>
# The Final Result
<p>
    Remember our obfuscated code comparison from above? Well this is how the comparison looks
    after running our script!
</p>

![](/posts/tackling-javascript-client-side-security-part-1/27.png)

<p>
    Suddenly a lot more readable! Some function names aren’t recoverable because they aren’t
    encoded but instead changed into some random garbage. Now that the code is in a more
    readable state you’re able to look through the file and figure out what it does!
</p>
<p>
    The next part of this series will cover what control flow obfuscation is and how to tackle
    it.
