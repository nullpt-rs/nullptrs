# Introduction

Debuggers serve as invaluable tools that empower developers to halt code execution and thoroughly 
analyze its behavior at any given moment. By utilizing a debugger, developers can efficiently 
identify and resolve issues within their code, making it an indispensable part of their toolkit.

Debuggers are equally valuable tools for reverse-engineers, especially when dealing with obfuscated 
code that frequently employs name-mangling techniques for variables and functions. By utilizing 
debuggers, reverse-engineers can gain crucial insights into the functionality of obscured functions. 
Companies that employ client-side protection are aware of this fact and thus devise strategies to thwart 
attempts at debugging protected code.

Once upon a time, whenever you tried to open your devtools on Supreme's website, you found yourself trapped 
in a pesky debugger loop. This made it incredibly annoying to reverse engineer their anti-bot scripts. 

## The Obvious Approach

In many browsers, there's an option to disable all breakpoints from triggering. While this approach will prevent 
getting stuck in a loop, it comes with a trade-off â€“ the debugger's functionality for further analysis becomes 
unavailable.

For complex scripts like the anti-bot employed by Supreme, this approach was simply not an option.

## Trying an Extension

Greasyfork scripts such as Anti Anti-debugger attempt to bypass these debugger traps by overriding the caller's 
function body, removing the debugger statements, and `eval` the new function. While this approach seemed promising, 
it unfortunately does not succeed with JScrambler-protected scripts due to the evaluation of debugger traps in a distinct 
context.

They also utilize integrity checks[^1] and hide debugger calls inside of further obfuscated eval functions[^2].

## The Final Approach

The approach my friend Jordin and I ultimately adopted involved renaming the debugger keyword entirely. 
By renaming it to something like "banana," the debugger would no longer trigger on occurrences of the `debugger` 
keyword. To achieve this, we built customized version of Firefox. If you're interested in trying 
this out, here's the patch we came up with.

Finding this was daunting as reading through a browser's codebase is never a fun time. A simple 
grep for a keyword like "debugger" could produce thousands of results, making the search 
even more challenging.

Many builds later, we tested our patch by loading the anti-bot script `ticket.js` and hooking 
`Array.prototype.slice`[^3] to call our new `ticket_debugger` keyword.

[^3]: Supreme's anti-bot system relied on the AES library [aes-js](https://github.com/ricmoo/aes-js), which utilizes `Array.prototype.slice` internally for managing encryption keys used on crucial cookies

## It works!

We introduced a new `ticket_debugger` keyword, which not only triggers a breakpoint but also resolves 
the issue of the previous debugger infinite loop. We also extended this custom browser to 
automatically retrieve the anti-bot's obfuscated encryption round keys and convert them back to their 
original form, but I'll cover that in a later post :)
