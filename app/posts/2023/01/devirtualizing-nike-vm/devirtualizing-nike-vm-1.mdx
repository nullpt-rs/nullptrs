Web-based attacks—such as account brute forcing and botting—pose a significant threat to companies
that rely on digital systems to store and process sensitive information. One technique to protect 
against these attacks is browser fingerprinting. This method works by collecting data about a user's 
browser, which is then used to create a unique fingerprint for differentiating between genuine users
and bots. However, browser fingerprints are easy to spoof and often fail to impede attackers.

This is where obfuscation comes in: by making scripts difficult for humans to read and understand, 
obfuscation can prevent the reverse engineering and emulation of browser fingerprints.

As attacks become more sophisticated, increasing layers of complexity are required to protect code. 
This has led to the development of virtualization obfuscation: the implementation of custom virtual 
machine like architecture. The real program is then stored as bytecode, which is decoded and 
interpreted by the virtual machine. In this blog post, we'll examine the virtualization obfuscation 
used by Nike contractor Kasada to protect Nike's web assets.

As my days of peddling anti-anti bot APIs are behind me, this article will focus less on the specifics 
of what data is collected, and more on dissecting the script's reverse engineering protections.

If you are curious, a production script can be found 
[here](https://accounts.nike.com/149e9513-01fa-4fb0-aad4-566afd725d1b/2d206a39-8ed7-437e-a3be-862e0f06eea3/ips.js).
The script may change slightly on each reload. The information should hold regardless of the
changes, as they are primarily different strings and function names. However, any significant updates
to the script may break some of the functions here.

# Script Structure
Lets begin by looking at the control flow of the main script. Collapsing all function definitions, we
reveal the following high-level structure:

```javascript
KPSDK.scriptStart = KPSDK.now();
(function() {
	function F(n) { ... }
	function t() { ... }
	function r(n, t) { ... }
	function i(n) { ... }
	function o(n) { ... }
	function u(n, t) { ... }
	var n = function (r) { ... }([function (n, t, r) { ... }]).eEA({ ... }, window, bytecode);
})();
```

The entirety of the script lies inside an 
[Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)
(IIFE), and the only explicit function calls in this scope is to the property `eEA`.

It is unclear what `eEA` represents, so we direct our attention to its parent. A cursory 
glance at the code is hardly illuminating.

A starting point for analyzing this function is not immediately clear. While we could
simply begin at the top of the function and analyze its flow, the nested definition of{' '}
`eEA` presents a more logical starting point. This function is then bound to
the input object `t`, and seems to be accessible from outside of `n`. 
This suggests that `eEA` is the main function and start of execution.

```javascript
function eEA(t, a, n) {
    for (var r = "string" == typeof n ? A.default.u(n) : n, i = r.length, v = "", o = {
      v: ""
    }, u = 0; u < 28; u++)
      v += String.fromCharCode(97 + Math.floor(26 * Math.random()));

    function s(n, t) {
      for (var r = [], i = 0; i < n; i++)
        r.push(t(i));
      return r
    }

    var d = function () {
      var f = 0;
      return function (n, t) {
        for (var r, i, o = 17 * f++ | 0, u = [], e = 0; e < 3; e++)
          u.push(e === o % 3 ? n : t());
        return r = Math.floor(20 * Math.random()),
          i = function () {
            return o % (this + r)
          }.bind(3 - r),
          function () {
            return u[i()]
          }
      }
    }()
    // further code omitted
    t.eEA = eEA
}
```

Looking at the arguments of `eEA`, the first input is an object with a single
property labeled as `inj0`. By looking at the syntax and copyright clause, we
can immediately write this off as a promise polyfill. Its purpose is to implement promise
functionality to legacy browsers.

```javascript
]).eEA({
"inj0":

typeof Promise != 'undefined' ? Promise : (function () {
"use strict";
function e(n) {
	var t = this.constructor;
	return this.then(function (e) {
		return t.resolve(n()).then(function () {
			return e
		})
	}, function (e) {
		return t.resolve(n()).then(function () {
			return t.reject(e)
		})
	})
}
// further code omitted
```

The second argument is the browser's window property: the main source of a browser
fingerprint. The final argument (replaced in Figure 1 as `bytecode` for
formatting reasons) should immediately stand out. This one comes in at a whopping 386000
characters. Hence, analyzing this string could be an important step in the reverse
engineering process. This will prove to be much more complex than in the average bot
protection program, and will be the focus of this article.

```

For brevity, the entire string has not been included. If you're curious, you can view 
it from the script linked above.

# VM Structure

Trying to understand the logic of `eEA` from a strictly static analysis
perspective is no easy task. (If any of you can evaluate bitwise logic and complex loops
in your head, please contact me). However, by following our bytecode through the
interpreter we can reveal its purpose.

```javascript
for (var r = "string" == typeof n ? A.default.u(n) : n, i = r.length, v = "", o = {
    v: ""
}, u = 0; u < 28; u++)
    v += String.fromCharCode(97 + Math.floor(26 * Math.random()));
```

Right off the bat, we notice that the variable `r` is set to the result of
`A.default.u(n)`. This variable definition is nested within a for loop and is
the result of a conditional expression. Luckily, as we know that the type of
`r` is a string for the call we are investigating, we can safely assume it is
set to `A.default.u(n)`.

As the definition of `A.default.u` is not immediately apparent, I used
breakpoints to find the function definition, as demonstrated below:

![Figure 2: The breakpoint I used to find the definition of <code>u(n)</code>](/posts/devirtualizing-nike-vm-1/breakpoint.webp)

We now find the function r.u (note this r is in a different scope!)

```javascript
r.u = function (n) {
  for (var t = s.P, r = t.V, i = t.W, o = r.length - i, u = [], e = 0; e < n.length;)
    for (var f = 0, c = 1; ;) {
      var a = r.indexOf(n[e++]);
      if (f += c * (a % i), a < i) {
        u.push(0 | f);
        break
      }
      f += i * c, c *= o
    }
  return u
}
```

Further exploration reveals the value of `s.P` to be an object with a 
hardcoded alphanumeric string and a number.

```javascript
// t.P is not a typo here, the two values are equal.
t.P = {
    V: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789",
    W: 50
}
```

It appears that `r.u` is a simple decoding function. Specifically, 
it seems to convert the string to a corresponding array of bytes.

Further down the body of `eEA`, we can see the following 
references to our array, `r`:

```javascript
var f = $()
, c = r[i + v.indexOf(".")] ^ i
, b = r.splice(c, r[c + f.g[0]] + 2);
```

Recalling how `v` is constructed (see the first snippet of `eEA`), and 
that `i` is simply the length of `r`, we deduce that a chunk of `r` is 
being isolated and removed. This removed chunk is stored as the 
variable `b`, but more on that later. Importantly, the type of our 
bytecode has not changed: it is still an array of bytes.

While our analysis thus far has not been particularly helpful, the final 
call to `r` reveals the true nature of this script.

```javascript
function y(n) {
    return r[n.g[0]++] >> 5
}

function M(n) {
    return A.default.R(r, n.g, o)
}

o.v = A.default.R(b, f.g[1].g());
var g = [];

function m(n, t) {
    n.g[y(n)] = t
}

// ...

function S(t) {
    for (; ;) {
        var n = g[r[t.g[0]++]];
        if (null === n)
            break;
        try {
            n(t)
        } catch (n) {
            O(t, n)
        }
    }
}

g.push(function (n) {
	m(n, M(n) + M(n))
}),
g.push(function (n) {
	m(n, M(n) - M(n))
}),
g.push(function (n) {
	m(n, M(n) * M(n))
}),
g.push(function (n) {
	m(n, M(n) / M(n))
}),
g.push(function (n) {
	m(n, M(n) % M(n))
}),
g.push(function (n) {
	m(n, +M(n))
}),
g.push(function (n) {
	m(n, !M(n))
}),

// ...
```

Examining `S(t)`—called on `f` as previously defined—we notice some interesting 
characteristics. `S(t)` runs a 
[state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), executing 
functions out of an array, `g`. Each of these functions takes in a single argument, 
`t`, and many of them follow a relatively simple pattern. Namely, they seem to use 
`m(n, t)` to store the output of a calculation, `M(n)` to retrieve various values, 
and `n` to store a “state” variable given by `$()`. I count around 60 of them. Lastly, 
the element of `g` to be run is chosen in a deterministic manner: a number 
given by `t.g[0]` points to an element of `r`, our bytecode, before being 
incremented.

If you've read veritas' previous article, [Reverse Engineering Tiktok's VM Obfuscation 
(Part 1)](https://www.nullpt.rs/reverse-engineering-tiktok-vm-1), this should scream 
virtualized JavaScript to you.

Applying our knowledge of computer architecture, we can now begin to assign meaning to 
each function. `S(t)` is a stepper function, executing the virtual machine's program in 
its argumentless loop. `g` is an array of short atomic functions, or opcodes, with 
instructions on when to call them. Recalling that we obtained the array from our 
initial string, this means that the string is a “program” of sorts, running inside of 
Kasada's custom virtual machine. Effectively, it is an array of opcode indices, 
register numbers, and other encoded information necessary to perform fingerprinting. 
`t.g[0]` is an instruction pointer, incrementing as the state machine is run, telling 
the script which element of `g` is next. If you haven't taken an operating system class, 
don't worry. I haven't either. It won't get much more technical than this.

As a final note for this section, we can confirm our suspicions on function calls 
`$()`, `y(n)`, `m(n)`, and `M(n)`. The return of `$()` is fed directly into `S(t)`, and 
has the following form:

```javascript
function $() {
  var n = [1, {
    h: a,
    M: null,
    $: [],
    g: function () {
        return [0]
    },
    j: function () {
        return [0]
    },
    O: function () { }
  }, void 0];
  return {
    j: h(),
    g: n,
    F: void 0
  }
}
```

As this is passed into every opcode, as well as the other three functions, we can 
conclude it acts as the VM state. A glance at `m(n)` reveals that it sets an element 
of the array `g` to the value `t`, analogous to setting register values in a conventional 
processor. Following this chain of logic, `y(n)` fetches the register number from the 
bytecode, and `M(n)` presumably retrieves a value from a register.

# Decoding the Bytecode

Now that we understand the problem at hand, it's clear that any attempt at de-virtualizing 
and understanding this script must begin with the decoding of the VM bytecode. Isolating 
the necessary code from that discussed above, we can use the following script to get the 
proper array of bytes, post splicing.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
                    
const bytecode = fs.readFileSync("./test/bytecode.txt", "utf8");

// this is constant. lmao
const decryptionConstants = {
    V: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789",
    W: 50,
};

function decodeBytecode(n) {
    for (
    var t = decryptionConstants,
    r = t.V,
    i = t.W,
    o = r.length - i,
    u = [],
    e = 0;
    e < n.length;

    )
    for (var f = 0, c = 1; ;) {
        var a = r.indexOf(n[e++]);
        if (((f += c * (a % i)), a < i)) {
        u.push(0 | f);
        break;
        }
        (f += i * c), (c *= o);
    }
    return u;
}

// note: edit made here to remove ternary. I assume function is not called on bytecode that is not of string form
// for (var r = decodeBytecode(bytecode), i = r.length, v = "", o = {
//     v: ""
// }, u = 0; u < 28; u++)
//     v += String.fromCharCode(97 + Math.floor(26 * Math.random()));

let decodedBytecode = decodeBytecode(bytecode);
// Removed v call, I do not believe it ever takes a value that is not "-1," as that would introduce randomness to the decryption process. 
// If it does can replace -1 back with "v.indexOf(".")"
// edit made here replacing i with the length of r.u(bytecode)
let c = decodedBytecode[decodedBytecode.length - 1] ^ decodedBytecode.length;

// replaced f.g[0] with 1
let bytecodeStrings = decodedBytecode.splice(c, decodedBytecode[c + 1] + 2);

console.log(decodedBytecode)

// [56,42,3,42,5,42,7,42,9,42,
// 11,42,13,42,15,42,17,42,19,
// 42,21,42,23,42,25,42,27,42,
// 29,42,31,42,33,42,35,42,37,
// 42,39,42,41,42,43,42,45,42,
// 47,42,49,50,123,6,8779,0,5, ...]
```

Which can be verified to match the array generated in the browser. Now that we are capable of 
retrieving the program's bytecode, we can use our knowledge of the VM's opcodes and registers 
to figure out what is happening. This will be done in a future article, and involves creating 
an interpreter, and eventually a decompiler for the VM's unique language.

# String Retrieval

However, there is one important part of this process that we have neglected. Inspired by veritas' 
previous article, I decided to try to find a way to retrieve strings from the bytecode. During my 
search, I suddenly remembered the spliced out section of the bytecode. At the time, I had been so 
pleased with my correct generation of the instruction array that it had totally slipped my mind.

Looking at references to the removed portion of the array, `b`, we see that it is used in a call to 
`A.default.R(b, f.g[1].g())`, a function also used in `M(n)`. As we theorized that `M(n)` retrieves 
values from the bytecode, perhaps this entire section of the array is simply the strings section! 
The definition of `R` validates this assumption:

```javascript
(r = i = i || {}).R = function (n, t, r) {
  var i, o, u, e, f = n[t[0]++];
  if (1 & f)
    return f >> 1;
  if (f === s.B.q)
    return e = n[t[0]++],
      i = n[t[0]++],
      o = 2147483648 & e ? -1 : 1,
      u = (2146435072 & e) >> 20,
      e = (1048575 & e) * Math.pow(2, 32) + (i < 0 ? i + Math.pow(2, 32) : i),
      2047 === u ? e ? NaN : 1 / 0 * o : (0 !== u ? e += Math.pow(2, 52) : u++,
        o * e * Math.pow(2, u - 1075));
  if (f !== s.B.D)
    return f === s.B.G || f !== s.B.H && (f === s.B.J ? null : f !== s.B.K ? t[f >> 5] : void 0);
  if (null != r && r._)
    return r._(n[t[0]++], n[t[0]++]);
  for (var c = "", a = n[t[0]++], v = 0; v < a; v++) {
    var l = n[t[0]++];
    c += String.fromCharCode(4294967232 & l | 39 * l & 63)
  }
  return c
}
```

From runtime analysis, we can make a few observations:

- The initial call to this function only provides two parameters, thus triggering the final return statement.
- Calls to this function from `M(n)` use three parameters, and return a call to `r._()`. This is how individual strings are retrieved.
- Nested in the confusing ternary statement is a call to a register value, which is usually returned if none of the other conditionals trigger.

If you're not convinced, the function r._() is defined as follows:

```javascript
o._ = function (n, t) {
  return o.v.slice(n, n + t)
}
```

Running this function with our value for b, removing conditionals not triggered on this call, 
and noting that `f.g[1].g()` simply returns `[0]` (see the definition of `$()`), we can add the 
following logic to our script:

```javascript
function decodeString(n, t) {
  // edit: removed variables and cases that are not relevant to this call.
  n[t[0]++];

  for (let c = "", a = n[t[0]++], v = 0; v < a; v++) {
    let l = n[t[0]++];
    c += String.fromCharCode((4294967232 & l) | ((39 * l) & 63));
  }
  return c;
}

let strings = decodeString(bytecodeStrings, [0]);

console.log(strings)
```

Which indeed returns the VM's strings, albeit concatenated together.

```

Recovering the individual strings is more complicated, as the value of the instruction pointer 
has to be known at the time `r._()` is run. A full dump of the strings can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/umasii/432c9ebf758ea4b5a21673c173112e8b).

# What now?

Although understanding the script architecture is likely sufficient to replicate a fingerprint through 
rigorous debugging, we have barely scratched the surface of disassembling the virtual machine. Now that 
we have a better understanding of the bytecode, as well as how it is decoded and interpreted, we can begin 
analyzing the opcodes and registers in an attempt to restore JavaScript pseudocode. Namely, in order to 
fully disassemble the virtual machine, it will be easiest to convert the bytecode to an intermediary representation, 
similar to assembly, before attemping to fully decompile the program.

However, that is a problem that will be tackled in the next post. In the meantime, I would encourage those who are 
curious to play with the code themselves. Investigate how variables are stored in registers and later retrieved. 
Whether or not there are further patterns in the opcodes, that can perhaps be used to generate traces without simply 
running the VM. How can we tackle the problem of subroutines in the virtualization, or the control flow necessary for 
the implementation of different loops?

While I have the answers to some of these questions, the work is far from done. In the meantime, a few brief thanks are 
in order:

- Veritas: For being one of my first teachers through his open source repositories and blog posts, as well as for publishing this article.
- Musicbot: For subliminally planting these ideas in my head over 2 years ago, and helping me cultivate my love for reverse engineering back in the day.
